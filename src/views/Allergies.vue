      <p class="cell large-12">
        Some humans have an allergic reaction to one or more allergens produced
        by cats. The most common of these allergens are the glycoprotein Fel d
        1, secreted by the cat's sebaceous glands and Fel d 4, which is
        expressed in saliva. An allergic reaction is a histamine reaction that
        is usually characterized by coughing, wheezing, chest tightening,
        itching, nasal congestion, rash, watering eyes, sneezing, chapped lips,
        and similar symptoms. In some severe cases, reactions may progress
        rapidly to cause the victim's airway to become inflamed and close up,
        requiring emergency medical attention. Those with severe,
        life-threatening cat allergies face tremendous challenges due to lack of
        public awareness about anaphylactic cat allergies, and do not enjoy the
        same conscientiousness from the public as those with a food allergy
        might, due to widespread knowledge of allergies to allergens such as
        nuts or dairy. Five cat allergens have been described in medical
        literature. The two major allergens are Fel d 1 (a secretoglobin) and
        Fel d 4 (a lipocalin). The minor allergens include Fel d 2 (an albumin),
        Fel d 3 (a cystatin), and cat IgA.

        Fel d 4 is the product of the cat major urinary protein gene. It is
        primarily expressed in the submandibular salivary gland and is deposited
        onto dander as the cat grooms his or her self. A study found that 63% of
        people allergic to cats have antibodies against Fel d 4. Symptoms of an
        allergic reaction to cats range from mild to severe, and include
        swollen, red, itchy, and watery eyes; nasal congestion, itchy nose,
        sneezing, chronic sore throat or itchy throat, coughing, wheezing,
        asthma, hay fever,[3] hives or rash on the face or chest, or itchy skin.
        If a cat has scratched, licked, or bitten someone who is allergic to
        cats, redness and sometimes even swelling of the affected area will
        occur. For those severely allergic, a reaction may resemble that of
        someone with a severe food allergy, and such reactions require emergency
        medical care. Allergens that are airborne survive for months or even
        years by themselves, hence removing anything that can trap and hold the
        allergens (carpet, rugs, pillows) and cleaning regularly and thoroughly
        with HEPA filters and electrostatic air purifier systems reduces risk.
        Frequent hand washing, especially after handling the cat, and washing
        hands prior to touching eyes, nose, or mouth, and limiting the cat's
        access to certain rooms, such as the bedroom or other rooms where much
        time is spent, may also reduce allergic reactions.Cat allergies can
        often be controlled with over the counter or prescription medications.
        Antihistamines and decongestants may provide allergy relief.

        Some allergy sufferers find relief in allergen immunotherapy, a periodic
        injection therapy designed to suppress the body's natural immune
        responses to the cat allergens. The synthetic epitope vaccine is an
        in-development vaccine to provide a long-term vaccine for allergies.
        Regularly bathing the cat may remove significant amounts of allergens
        from the fur. Furthermore, regularly brushing the cat will reduce the
        amount of loose fur (and its attached saliva) in the air. Feeding the
        cat a high quality diet with plenty of omega-3 fatty acids will help
        keep the coat healthy and minimize dander. A hypoallergenic cat is a cat
        that is less likely to provoke an allergic reaction in humans. Although
        the topic is controversial, several other breeds, especially females,
        are likely to have low levels of Fel d 1, the main allergenic protein.

        The common theory among these two hypoallergenic medium- to long-haired
        cat breeds is that their long-haired gene is associated with producing
        reduced amounts of allergens. This may be the case as the Balinese cat,
        a medium to long-haired cat breed (also referred to as the Long-haired
        Siamese cat) is regarded as hypoallergenic, whereas the Siamese cat, a
        short-haired breed, is not. Some Siamese cats might possess
        hypoallergenic qualities if they have Balinese ancestry. This might
        provide some evidence that the long-haired genes or traits within this
        cat breed have resulted in a cat that can genetically produce less
        amounts of the cat allergens. Female cats produce a lower level of
        allergens than males, and neutered males produce a lower level of
        allergens than unneutered males. In 2000, researchers at the Long Island
        College Hospital found that cat owners with dark-colored cats were more
        likely to report allergy symptoms than those with light-colored cats. A
        later study by the Wellington Asthma Research Group found that fur color
        had no effect on how much allergen a cat produced.
